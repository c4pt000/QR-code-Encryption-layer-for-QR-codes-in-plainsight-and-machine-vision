# THIS DESIGN *CAN NOT* ENCODE A STRING LONGER THAN 111 CHARACTERS INSIDE OF THE QR CODE

# encrypted version in motion to protect the QR code with encryption

<p>
 DO NOT USE A SIX DIGIT PIN TO A PROTECT A PAPER WALLET WIF BECAUSE IT CAN BE CRACKED WITH BRUTE FORCE IN UNDER 2 HOURS


FOR A CRYPTOCURRENCY PRIVATE KEY WIF USE AT LEAST A 12-15 ALPHANUMERIC PASSCODE (INSTEAD OF 000000 - 999999)

THE RANDOM SIX DIGIT PIN CHOICE IS ONLY TO DEMONSTRATE AS A CONCEPT MODEL HOW THIS CAN BE TIED TO A 2FA GENERATOR ON A PHONE OR WITH SMS WHERE THE PIN CHANGES WITH THE QR CODE

DO NOT USE WEAK PINS FOR NON-2FA ENCRYPTION (THIS WAS ONLY AN EXAMPLE IF IT WERE ENABLED FOR 2FA SUPPORT)

WIP** eventually

(2 years ago I thought it could sit in the middle of the QR code directly which is also possible instead of picking a specific corner of the larger QR code)

# the QR code has to have a small region visible of pin dots within the rest of the pin dots a QR code inside of a QR code around 25 px by 25 px for a 250 px by 250 px size QR code (guestimate) the smaller QR code has a region that is generated for an OTP or 2FA pin to allow a camera to do the visual detection to allow import from the client side into the device


* for sensitive data QR code import
(this is a fictious QR code just as a visual mental experiment / explaination


QR code opens a statue of liberty informational from wikipedia from the smaller QR code in the image but really the smaller QR code would load a pin request to the phone and the smaller QR code would be generated from the phone's QR client that generats a pin to generate the smaller QR code the larger QR code would be compressed QR code data of the actual data that is protected by the smaller QR code


maybe this kind of design could help the regular end user better visually recoginze that the QR code has a layer of protection with a pin instead of being interwoven right into the middle of the QR code

easier
# centered by lastpass type of engine for PIN generator centered at X,Y 0,0 of QR generated larger QR code generates with a hole in the middle for the pin pattern around the 2FA layer in the middle by part of the 2FA layer is part of the exterior QR code that is generated




data must be interwoven between larger exterior QR code and internal smaller QR code,

(the internal QR code can use maybe something similar to the lastpass engine to generate a QR code based on PIN)
(the (larger)exterior QR code interweaves in the right hand corner(north west corner)  by 1/4 of the internal QR code by pixel/image size


the camera doing the import of the QR has to recoginze the pattern as double QR code as a protect QR code to request a pin to enter on the camera side to decode the double QR code protected by pin

fictious real world example / application as a visual mental experiment / explaination

current QR codes are unprotected from any shoulder surfer with a QR code enabled smart phone

whether it is a QR code for cryptocurrency or a QR code for password logins generated for QR code import


this *would* be a QR code protecting this website from loading into any nearby device if it was tied a login (obviously this is the banks screen before a login and password is needed but just for an example if it was other sensitive information)

centered



HYOSUNG also protecting a receipt from being imported from someone nearby to stop social engineering campaigns of someone knowing X amount of dollars from withdrawal or deposit trying to social engineer the bank on the phone when they ask about X amount of money

# update noticed this news story

https://threatpost.com/qr-codes-cyberattack-usage-spikes/165526/

^^ non protected QR code images without a binding OTP or 2FA pin encoded into the QR as a small grouping of dots (through a QR code generator linked to a 2FA key or OTP key to generate a key to allow a phone or camera client to make the import to the device)

as proposed below a few years ago


# QR-code-Encryption-layer-for-QR-codes-in-plainsight
QR code Encryption layer for QR codes in plainsight

to add a layer to the standard model of QR code engines for the random creation of QR codes to protect the QR code for authorized user application import

a signing key could be implemented as part of the QR pattern as layer of encryption and this same signing key used to generate the QR code could be imported into the application before any QR code is imported from the generating application to further protect QR codes from the misuse of most photographic equipment to protect and prevent the QR code from being imported to external applications outside of the user importing the QR code into said user's application

application authorized QR codes, using a signing key to generate the encryption layer as part of an extended pattern of the already existient QR code pattern generation nested in the QR code 

used to protect sensitive or financial information encoded into a QR code
